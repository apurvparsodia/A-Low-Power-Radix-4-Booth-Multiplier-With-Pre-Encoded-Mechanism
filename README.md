# A-Low-Power-Radix-4-Booth-Multiplier-With-Pre-Encoded-Mechanism

The major goal of this project is to create a pre-encoded mechanism that will increase multiplication's power efficiency by pre-encoding the two states in the booth multiplier so that it turns off the associated encoder and decoder. This project was created using the Xilinx Vivado tool using Verilog
